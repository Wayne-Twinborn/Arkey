# Nano 
The Nano is a side project for Arkey. A form factor that's even s smaller and cheaper by basically making an ergonomic keyboard layout.

### Features:
- Incredibly small size
- Hot swap key switch mounts
- All the other features of the Arkey

### Requirements:
- PCB
- 18 standard keyboard keyswitches
- 18 standard keyboard keycaps
- Raspberry Pi Pico with headers



# Nano Swap
This is a rev 2 of the Nano that uses Kailh hot swap sockets and switches.
I'm maintaining both versions here because there is a price difference between the 2 boards.

### Features
- All the same but with hot swap keyswitches

### Requirements
- PCB
- 18 Kailh hot swap sockets
- 18 Kailh hot swap compatible keyswitches
- Raspberry pi pico with headers
