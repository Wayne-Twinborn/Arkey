Arcade Keyboard. Intended to be a super small form factor WASD controller for fighting games that's cheap and easy to source.  


## TLDR/I wanna get one  
If you want to build it yourself, check the "MakeMe" folder. You'll have to build it. I don't sell them at the moment. I'll probably gift off the batch of PCB I made. This project is to allow individuals and companies to have a cheap and easy option to build a stick. 

## About the project
This is a pet project because the only company (at the time I started) that was making super small form factor leverless controllers had all but abandoned their WASD line.   
Traditional leverless style (with up at the bottom of the controller) hurts my wrists and is unintuitive to me. This fixes both issues.   
My goal of giving myself a controller that suits my needs has been met. I'll continue to iterate on the design, but I want to turn it over to the community.   

# Versions
### ArkeyV1
This is the easiest one to build and source parts for. It uses standard 5 pin MX keyswitches and a pico with headers, hard soldered to the PCB. It's the largest entry in the project.

### ArkeyV2
This is a significantly improved Arkey. Much smaller size, uses hot swap sockets and switches, and the case can be printed on printers with a bed of around 190mmx 115mm. This is harder to assemble than the V1 by virtue of surface mounting the Pico and using hot swap sockets instead of mounting the switches directly. This is the recommended version of the Arkey.

### Arkey Nano V1
This is a version of the Arkey that uses keycaps instead of button caps. It's designed, effectively, to be an ergonomic keyboard to play on. This is the smallest option and it's easier to source keycaps than it is to source button caps.


### Licensing
This project is under the open source hardware license. Details are in the LICENSE file.
A short version is that you can distribute, produce, or modify as you like. No warranty or liabilty. 
I would be happy to see people building and selling the Arkey. 


## Contributing
If you want to contribute, the "Source" folder has all you need to work on the design. All of the tools I used to make it are freely available. And if you don't like them, there are plenty of alternatives. Chances are if you're going to dive into it  you already have tool preferences. 

#### Dev tools
- EasyEDA: PCB design for the V1 Arkey
- Kicad: PCB design for all other models. 
- FreeCAD: Case design  
- Krita: Art template  

### Contribution Requirements
You must include a description of what you've done and you must have a working prototype (meaning fully assembled PCB) on hand. 


I did this for free and will continue working on it when time and money allows, but if you do want to tip, here's my Ko-fi.
