# Arkey  
 Arcade Keyboard. Intended to be a super small form factor WASD controller for fighting games.   


TLDR:-----------------------  
 In the "MakeMe" folder you'll find what you need to put it together.  
 DXF files to cut the acrylic, EasyEDA files to order the PCB, and a text doc with instructions, including links to the electronics you'll want.   

Features:  
 Small size  
 Small price  
 GP2040-CE microcontroller for compatability and customization  
 Common components. Just a pico, 18 keyboard keyswitches, and the relevant caps is all you need to get it working.   


This is a pet project because the only company (at the time I started) that was making super small form factor leverless had all but abandoned their WASD line.   
Hitbox style hurts my writs and is unintuative to me.   
My goal of giving myself a controller that suits my needs has been met. I'll continue to itterate on the design, but I want to turn it over to the community.  

The project is under GPL 3 basically so that anyone can continue working on it and that work can carry forward.   
It also lets people sell products made from it. I hope this helps get more of them into the community so it can help people with wrist issues like me.   



If you want to contribute, the "Source" folder has all you need to work on the design.   
Dev tools:  
 EasyEDA: PCB design  
 FreeCAD: Case design  
 Krita: Art template  


I did this for free and will continue working on it when time and money allows, but if you do want to tip, here's my Ko-fi.
