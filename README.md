Arcade Keyboard. Intended to be a super small form factor WASD controller for fighting games that's cheap and easy to source.

## TLDR/I wanna get one  
If you want to build it yourself, check the "MakeMe" folder. You'll have to build it. I don't sell them at the moment. I'll probably gift off the batch of PCB I made. This project is to allow individuals and companies to have a cheap and easy option to build a stick.  


### Features:  
- Small size  
- Small price  
- GP2040-CE microcontroller for compatibility and customization  
- Common components. Just a pico, 18 keyboard key-switches, and the relevant caps is all you need to get it working.   

### About the project
This is a pet project because the only company (at the time I started) that was making super small form factor leverless controllers had all but abandoned their WASD line.   
Hitbox style hurts my wrists and is unintuitive to me.   
My goal of giving myself a controller that suits my needs has been met. I'll continue to iterate on the design, but I want to turn it over to the community.  

### Licensing
The project is under GPL 3 basically so that anyone can continue working on it and that work can carry forward.   
It also lets people sell products made from it. I hope this helps get more of them into the community so it can help people with wrist issues like me.   
The spirit of choosing this license is that I want the project to get as far as it can. I'd love for smaller producers like SGF to add the Arkey to their lineup so that people can have access to a smaller and more affordable option for WASD than is out there now.


## Contributing
If you want to contribute, the "Source" folder has all you need to work on the design. All of the tools I used to make it are freely available. And if you don't like them, there are plenty of alternatives. Chances are if you're going to dive into it  you already have tool preferences. 
#### Dev tools:  
- EasyEDA: PCB design  
- FreeCAD: Case design  
- Krita: Art template  
### Contribution Requirements:
You must include a description of what you've done and you must have a working prototype (meaning fully assembled PCB) on hand. 


I did this for free and will continue working on it when time and money allows, but if you do want to tip, here's my Ko-fi.
