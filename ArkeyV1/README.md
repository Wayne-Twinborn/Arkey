This version is perfectly usable and has been my primary controller for my 175ish hours of Street Fighter 6 so far. I love it very much. But it was also my first time putting together a pcb, first time working in freecad, and first time working with an FDM printer or acrylic.

Part of me wanted to just take this down and replace it with a new V1 because of its issues, but it works great and I love using it myself, so I'll leave it here.

The next revision is smaller and has drastic improvements from what I learned while creating the Nano v1. If you just have to have one, this one will do fine. But if you can wait for revision 2 (expected Sep 2023 at the latest) I would. It will have all the features but a lot of improvements.
