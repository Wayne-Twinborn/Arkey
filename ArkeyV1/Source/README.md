For this revision of the Arkey, the PCB is built using EasyEDA. That makes it easier to order on JLC. Future revisions I want to move to Kicad. 

The art template isn't perfect to the size of the buttons so be aware there will be areas outside the outlines that will be hidden.

The Acrylic is cut perfect to size so be aware your keycaps might be a tight fit in the function key row. Worst case scenario you can run it without the first and last caps. You can line it up though and have it work well. WASD and the button caps are fine though. 

## Contribution requirements
If you want to contribute to the hardware/art/case/etc, make sure you have a working prototype with your changes.

If you want to contribute to documentation, go ahead and put in a pull request.
